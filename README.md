# Guitar-Hero-PS3-QB-PAK-Findings
Extracted QB/DBG files for GHWT for PLAYSTATION 3, and some general infos about said files.
# How to anaylze these files
Use [010Editor](https://www.sweetscape.com/download/010editor/) and [GHSDK](https://gitgud.io/fretworks/guitar-hero-sdk) to analyze these files. As of right now the GHSDK cannot properly extract `QB.PAK.PS3` files, meaning not all `QB` Scripts are present. Most files are empty.
# Copywrite dislaimer and warning
Use/distubution of these files is not against copywrite law, however in some areas of the world it may still. GH is an `abandonware`, meaning the original IP (`Intelectual Property`) holders have thrown it away. However, this does not mean you should sell these files or the tools used to extract them. If you find anyone trying to sell `010Editor`, `GHSDK`, or `QueenBee`, please contact me on Discord, or the `GHSDK` Team.
# Notes
Huge thanks to Dodylectable for the help with this. Hope the SDK gets fixed soon.
